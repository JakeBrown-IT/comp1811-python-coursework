# comp1811-python-coursework
Python Coursework for my COMP1811 Paradigms of Programming Module.

This is the Coursework Project for the Python section of the module.

The program's purpose is to simulate a social network using a text file provided by the user. The program then prompts the user with various different options for manipulating the data and displaying it to the user. 

The options include:
- Recommending a friend for a specific user.
- Displaying the friend count of a specific user.
- Showing the users with zero/least amount of friends across the network.
- Displaying all of a specific users friends.
- Displaying all the indirect friends (friends of friends) of a specific user.

This program could possibly be open for improvements in the future.
